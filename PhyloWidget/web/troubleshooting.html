<h1 style="">Troubleshooting PhyloWidget</h1>
<p>
All software has its flaws, and PhyloWidget is no exception. If you're having trouble running PhyloWidget, this could be
caused by a number of problems. Below is a checklist of potential issues
and our recommended solutions; please let us know if what you're experiencing is not covered here!
</p>
<ul id="Troubleshooting Checklist">
	<li>
		<h1> General Problems</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="heading">Browser crash / freeze-up</span></li>
				<p>
					With certain versions of Firefox, Java, and Windows XP or Vista, we have observed the browser crashing
					entirely when PhyloWidget <em>or any other Java applet</em> is run. If this is happening to you, please visit <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java.com</a> and update your
					version of Java.
				</p>
			<li>
				<span class="heading">Sluggish / strange behavior</span>
				<p>
					The main point is this: <em>Most strange or sluggish behavior in PhyloWidget can be fixed by restarting your browser!!</em>
				<p>
					Usually refreshing the browser will not fix problems with sluggishness. The Java runtime environment stays loaded for the entire
					time the browser is running, so the only way to give PhyloWidget a "fresh start" is to completely quit the browser, and then start it back up.
				<p>
					<em>To reiterate:</em> <span style="font-style:italic;">If you're having a problem with PhyloWidget suddenly acting strange, 90% of the time restarting the browser will solve it!</span>
				</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<span class="heading">OutOfMemory Error / Java heap space</span>
				<p>
					If you see either of these error message while using PhyloWidget, or the program appears to putter out when working with large trees or images,
					then the operation you attempted may be using more memory than is allocated to Java applets by default.
					</p><p>The simplest solution is to download the standalone version of PhyloWidget from the homepage and run the program as an application,
					where more memory is allocated to the JVM. 
					</p><p>Another option is to edit your computer-specific applet settings to allocate
					more memory: see the relevant <a href="http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=523105&messageID=3033288">Java forum thread</a>, or
					search Google for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=java+applet+heap+space">java applet heap space</a>. One set of visual instructions
					for Windows XP can be found <a href="http://www.duckware.com/pmvr/howtoincreaseappletmemory.html">here</a>.
				</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<span class="heading">Web links don't work</span>
				<p>
					On some browsers, especially Firefox, we have noticed PhyloWidget's "web link" popups getting blocked. If this is the case, configure
					your browser's popup blocker to allow phylowidget.org to create popups.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="heading">Error pop-ups</span>
				<p>
					Some users, especially on Linux systems, have reported seeing pop-up messages mentioning <code>Null Pointer Exceptions</code> when trying
					to load PhyloWidget. If you see this, please <em>submit a bug report!</em>
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Browser Compatibility Issues</h1>
		<p>
			The fact that PhyloWidget is happy to live within a browser is convenient for quick, easy access online. However, browser
			support for Java is notoriously ill-formed, and despite our best efforts to maximize compatibility, some issues still remain.
			We can offer some very general advice:
		<p>
		<em>If you are on a Mac,</em> we recommend using Safari to access PhyloWidget.
		<p>
		<em>If you are on a PC,</em> we recommend using Firefox to access PhyloWidget.
		<p>
		Here are some specific browser / OS issues that we have encountered:
		<ul style="margin-left:40px;">
			<li> <em>OS X / Firefox 2.0:</em> PhyloWidget's Toolbox components may be non-functional.
			<p> <em>Solution:</em> use the Safari browser.</p>
			</li>
			<li> <em>OS X / Safari:</em> The screen flickers when the Node Info box is updated.
			<p> <em>Solution:</em> Click "hide" to hide the toolbox and stop the updating.</p>
			</li>
			<li> <em>Linux / Firefox:</em> We have heard reports from users using the OpenJDK and/or IcedTea that PhyloWidget does not work
			with their system. If this is the case for you, please <a href="index.html#contact">contact us</a> so we can track down and fix the problem.
			<p> <em>Solution:</em> use the Sun JVM on Linux.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p/>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h1>Java Requirements</h1>
		<p>
			<em>PhyloWidget requires Java 1.5 or higher</em> (this is also known as Java 5.0). Most modern systems, including OS X and Windows XP, should have this installed;
			if for some reason it appears that Java is not set up correctly on your system, simply visit <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java.com</a> to download the
			latest version.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h1>Found a bug?</h1>
<p>
If you've found a specific, well-defined problem that doesn't fall under the categories above, then you probably found
a bug in PhyloWidget. Sorry&mdash;it happens! If you have a few minutes to spare and are feeling particularly helpful, 
please do head over to our project site and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phylowidget/issues/list">submit a bug report</a>.
