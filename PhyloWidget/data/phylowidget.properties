### UI PROPERTIES
###
## Points to the menu definition XML file.
menuFile = menus/full-menus.xml
#menuFile = menus/limited-menus.xml
#menuFile = menus/minimal-menus.xml
## Indicates the JavaScript functions to be called when updating the tree and clipboard areas.
# *** Note that when using Javascript to update PhyloWidget's tree and clipboard, you must
# call the JAVA methods "updateTree" and "updateClip" respectively.
treeJavascript = updateTree
clipJavascript = updateClip

### STYLE PROPERTIES
###
## Size of the node "dots". Values between 0 and 1 are suitable.
nodeSizeMultiplier = 0.25
## Thickness of the tree lines. Values between 0.01 and ~0.25 are suitable.
lineThicknessMultiplier = .075
## Text rotation, in degrees
textRotation = 0

### TREE-HANDLING PROPERTIES
###
## Determines whether the tree enforces node label uniqueness or not.
enforceUniqueLabels = true
## Determines whether inner nodes (i.e. clades) have their labels shown.
showCladeLabels = true
## This one is a strange one, but in case someone needs this behavior:
## This option determines whether the tree will include ALL inner node names within the tree,
## including the "dummy labels" used to maintain label uniqueness. Even if set to false, PhyloWidget
## will still output inner nodes with "real" labels and ALL leaves, even if they have a "dummy label".
outputAllInnerNodes = false
